* /u/Gitpush1337 for the expanded drop database csv file.
* /u/csdx for making a Query() that made the filtered Enlir tabs usable.
* The StackOverflow community for both being helpful angels and gatekeeping jackasses.
* And most importantly, /u/enlir and /u/MysteriousMisterP. These folks literally made the game playable and are sorely missed.
