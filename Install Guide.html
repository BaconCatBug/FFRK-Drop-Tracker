<p>This guide is intended to aid anyone and everyone <s>in getting a way to display the drops of a battle without having to complete it, thus allowing for more time efficient farming of Magicite, Motes, Major Orbs, Crystals and anything else you may desire; or</s> (the former functionaly is utterly redundant in modern FFRK, but is kept in case you really need it for some reason or want to time your farming runs in a really overcomplicated way) in getting their Final Fantasy Record Keeper inventory, Soul Breaks, abilities and orbs in a usable csv format, primarily for use with my spreadsheets linked at the top of this guide.</p>

<p>But no man is island, for men are not made of rocks. Extra special thanks to the following Redditors without whom none of this would have been possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/vexnon">/u/vexnon</a> for making the mitmproxy scripts</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Gitpush1337">/u/Gitpush1337</a> for an expanded drop database csv file</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/csdx">/u/csdx</a> for informing me of the =Query() formula</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/cinaeth">/u/cinaeth</a> for troubleshooting an annoying bypass list issue.
<li>And most importantly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/enlir">/u/enlir</a>. These folks literally made the game playable and are sorely missed.</li>
</ul>

<p>*******************************</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT PREPARATION START</strong></p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT AN EMULATOR IS NOT MANDATORY TO USE EITHER TOOL, IT'S JUST EASIER. YOU CAN SET UP A PROXY ON YOUR LOCAL NETWORK AND SET YOUR PHONE TO CONNECT TO THE PROXY.</strong></p>

<p>*******************************</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The very first thing you need to do is make sure that CPU Virtualisation is enabled/supported by your PC. Without it, any form of android emulation is going to run slower than molasses uphill at the South Pole.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, ensure your game is linked to your Google Play account. This will allow you to swap seamlessly between your phone and PC.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an Android Emulator of your choice. The two main choices are Bluestacks and MeMu Play. Personally, I use Bluestacks (with the caveat that it requires extra config via ProxyCap and BSTweaker due to it's locked down nature), with MeMu being my alternitive. Nox is just too slow IMO. Also, MeMu is Chinese so... -shrug-. Bluestacks is a little annoying with it's popups but it's the best of a bad bunch, maybe? IDK you need to decide for yourself. </p></li>
<li><p>(In MeMu): Click on the Settings shortcut, scroll down to "Date and Time", disable "Automatic Time Zone" (although keep "Automatic Date and Time") and manually pick your location in "Select Time Zone".</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a non-English keyboard layout, you may need to change the keyboard language in the "Language and Input" section of the settings panel or as a last resort clicking the "Default" setting there and disabling the physical keyboard altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Google Play store, click the top left button, go to "My Apps" and run any updates needed. Then search for and install "Google Play Games" and then "Final Fantasy Record Keeper". <strong>The order is important.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If for some reason FFRK isn't showing on the app store because DeNA is too restrictive on it's compatible devices setting, install it manually <a href="https://apkpure.com/final-fantasy-record-keeper/com.dena.west.FFRK/">with the APK from APKPure</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*******************************</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT PREPARATION END</strong></p>

<p>*******************************</p>

<p>0) Install the x86 version of the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Go to <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">https://mitmproxy.org/</a> and click the "Download Windows Installer" link. Use the latest release.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Run the installer, clicking next until the final window. Uncheck "Run the UI" or close it if it did run.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<input class="spoilerbutton" type="button" value="Show BlueStacks Instructions" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show BlueStacks Instructions'?'Hide BlueStacks Instructions':'Show BlueStacks Instructions';">
<div class="spoiler">
<div>
3) Download <a href="https://bstweaker.tk//">BSTweaker</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
4) Run BSTweaker. Click the "Play" button for the BlueStacks instance your FFRK is installed on. Once it has loaded, click the Radio button to the left of your BlueStacks instance to select it. Go to the "Root" tab, click "Patch", then once it's finished, click "Install SuperSu".



<p>&nbsp;</p>
5) Open the Play Store and install "Root Certificate Manager(ROOT)" by JoshTheMan. We will use this in a bit to install a certificate.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
6) Install <a href="http://www.proxycap.com/download.html/">ProxyCap</a>, then reboot. THE REBOOT IS NOT OPTIONAL!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
7a) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uf5n2CHj88x3oHtFBaOAu4VLylX4uST8/view?usp=sharing">Download the Ruleset for Proxycap</a> and apply it by right clicking ProxyCap > Configuration > Ruleset > Load.
<br><br>
7b) Alternitively, follow the <a href="http://www.proxycap.com/bluestacks.html/">ProxyCap Bluestacks guide</a>, with the following exeptions:<br><li>For both the HTTP and HTTPS proxy, set the hostname to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8888</li><br><li>When you create the HTTP proxy RULE (not the proxy itself), say "Yes" when it asks to restrict the port. </li><br><li>The HTTPS Proxy RULE must affect all ports, not just port 433.</li><br><li>Follow the Extended Configuration and set all three .exe to use the HTTPS proxy</li><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cL7cOZm.png"</img><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eooNqzq.png"</img>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

8) Exit the .bat files and replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with 127.0.0.1

<p>&nbsp;</p>
9) Run the Exporter or the Drop Peeker .bat and enable ProxyCap. YOU MUST HAVE ONE OF THESE RUNNING TO ACT AS A PROXY SERVER FOR THE MAGIC CERTIFICATE URL TO WORK! In the emulator, open a browser and go to mitm.it where it should show a list of certificates. Click the "Get mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer" button for android, then click cancel when the system popup happens.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
10) Open Root Certificate Manager, click the Folder at the top, click the top left Burger menu, click Downloads, then click the certificate you just downloaded, then click Import.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
11) When you want BlueStacks to run though the Exporter, enable ProxyCap while the Exporter is running.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) To export your data, run the Exporter, enable ProxyCap, load FFRK, click the Inventory button, then the View/Sell Items button, then the Vault Button, then each tab in the vault (if you enable thos last options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13) Boom, you should have a whole bunch of .csv (Comma Separated Values) files with all your lovely data. <a href="http://prntscr.com/ff9xwc">http://prntscr.com/ff9xwc</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
14) Use my Spreadsheets or Jareth's site linked at the top of the guide if you so desire.
</div></div>
<input class="spoilerbutton" type="button" value="Show MeMu/Android Phone/Other Emulator Instructions" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show MeMu/Android Phone/Other Emulator Instructions'?'Hide MeMu/Android Phone/Other Emulator Instructions':'Show MeMu/Android Phone/Other Emulator Instructions';">
<div class="spoiler"><div>

<p>3) Find your local IP and write it down somewhere. There are many ways to do this. If you're savvy enough to do it with ipconfig /all, do so. For the non-tech savvy, you can use this site, you want the top IP <a href="http://prntscr.com/feuhx6">http://prntscr.com/feuhx6</a><a href="https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address">https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4) Fire up your Android Emulator. Click "Settings", then "Wifi". If it says "Connected via wifi assistant", toggle the wifi off and on, then click to connect to the network. Long press the network, click "Modify Network", Click "Advanced Options", click on the "None" under Proxy and change it to "Manual". <a href="http://prntscr.com/feujr2">http://prntscr.com/feujr2</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5) Set the Proxy hostname to the IP noted down before. Set the port to 8888. In the "Bypass proxy for" box, copy and paste one of the following without quotes. If the "Save" button is greyed out, check for erroneous spaces. <a href="http://prntscr.com/feul26">http://prntscr.com/feul26</a></p>

<p>Global:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1,lcd-prod.appspot.com,live.chartboost.com,android.clients.google.com,googleapis.com,app.adjust.io,android.googleapis.com
</code></pre>

<p>Japan:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1,lcd-prod.appspot.com,live.chartboost.com,android.clients.google.com,googleapis.com,ssl.sp.mbga-platform.jp,ssl.sp.mbga.jp,app.adjust.io,android.googleapis.com
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Once you set up your emulator to point at the proxy, it will need to be running whenever you load up the game on that emulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6) Set up a new folder somewhere for you to work in. Go here to get the scripts:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BaconCatBug/FFRK-Drop-Tracker">https://github.com/BaconCatBug/FFRK-Drop-Tracker</a></p>

<p>Go there and click "Clone or Download &gt; Download Zip" in the top right corner. <a href="http://prntscr.com/fht3gy">http://prntscr.com/fht3gy</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7) Hold Shift and Right Click some empty space and open a command window in that folder (This is important, don't run it from the start menu). Run the top script to see drops, the bottom script to export inventory:</p>

<pre><code>mitmdump -q --listen-host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --listen-port 8888 -s FFRK_Drop_Tracker_v6.12.py
</code></pre>

<h2></h2>

<pre><code>mitmdump -q --listen-host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --listen-port 8888 -s FFRK_Inventory_Exporter_v6.12.py
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: "mitmdump" is the proxy program, "-q" is quiet mode so it doesn't spam the screen with traffic, "--listen-host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" listens to the IP given to the proxy, --listen-port specifies the port and "-s FFRK_Drop_Tracker_v6.12.py" means to run the script FFRK_Drop_Tracker_v6.12.py. Note you need to replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your IP found in step 3.</p>

<p>The included Batch (.bat) files can be edited so you don't need to manually type the command every time. If you make a .bat you can replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with %COMPUTERNAME% but sometimes this results in an incorrect IP being detected. If this happens, just change it back to a raw IP.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Unless you've set a static local IP (and you'll know if you have), your local IP can sometimes change. If things stop working, check if this has happened and edit the command accordingly. </p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Due to the -q flag, it might look like nothing is happening. This is not the case, it is still running in the background. The -q flag even suppresses the "Proxy server listening at" message.</p>

<p><strong>YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Once you set up your emulator to point at the proxy, it will need to be running whenever you load up the game on that emulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8) If everything is set up correctly, mitmproxy will run and start listening for connections. <a href="http://prntscr.com/h1bacn">http://prntscr.com/h1bacn</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9) In your emulator, load up FFRK.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To export your Inventory, run the command from step 7 with the FFRK_Inventory_Tracker_6.12.py in it:</p>

<p>10a) Click the Inventory button, then the View/Sell Items button, then the Vault Button, then each tab in the vault.</p>

<p>10b) Boom, you should have a whole bunch of .csv (Comma Separated Values) files with all your lovely data. <a href="http://prntscr.com/ff9xwc">http://prntscr.com/ff9xwc</a></p>

<p>10c) Use my spreadsheets <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aJ-y4b2-ulyEJHO2-FuH8mQkmaSrPKN04bwWHOWIFWI/">FFRK Soul Break, Ability and Orb Graphical Inventory</a> to have a nice way of sharing your stuff.</p>

<p>10d) Microsoft Excel is preferred. If you use Libreoffice, set the import encoding to UTF-8.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To farm drops, run the command from step 7 with the FFRK_Drop_Tracker_v6.12.py in it:</p>

<p>11a) Enter a battle.</p>

<p>11b) Boom, you should see your drops! <a href="http://prntscr.com/fht31i">http://prntscr.com/fht31i</a></p>

<p>If anyone has any questions or suggestions on improving this guide, please let me know.</p>

<p>I have not tested doing this with a phone pointed to a PC running the mitmproxy on a local network. It should work (I think) but I have not tested it.</p>
